        &#183; <span class="spanA">DO NO RUSH </span> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        {Rushing is a very common mistake. Normally a new player thinks that
        upgrading TownHall to the max is everything Ideally, you should be
        maxing out every building before upgrading your town hall. Your first
        priority should be your offensive structures, which are the Clan Castle
        for troops and the laboratory for upgrades. You can follow up with the
        army camps to increase the capacity of your army, followed by the
        strongest defenses.}

        {Gem is very important. When getting assisted by the lady villager, it
        will tell you to use gems to finish the upgrading process fast. You
        should not use your gems for useless things. In the future, you will
        need a lot of gems to buy builders. So, start saving your gems now.}

        <span class="spanA">Utilise the Practice Mode </span>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {The Practice Mode has been added in an update
        a few years ago, and players can use it to try out and discover new army
        compositions for attacks. You will eventually realize that you need to
        use tanks in your army which will soak up the damage from the enemy
        defenses while your other troops attack them.}

        <span class="spanA"> Always Keep The Laboratory Busy </span>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; {You might have a lot of builders but only have
        a laboratory. Upgrading your troops is essential if you want to keep up
        with your Town Hall Level. Whenever you have a Town Hall upgrade, make
        sure that the Laboratory is almost done as well. You can set an upgrade
        to go in the lab, and immediately upgrade the lab itself to the next
        level to save some time.}

        <span class="spanA"> Walls are actually worth it </span>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; { Walls might seem really, really expensive
        once you get to the higher levels, but it’s necessary for a good
        defense. A base that has weak walls leaves its structures exposed. The
        center of your base can be easily reached with low-level troops, so to
        ensure that it doesn’t happen you should max them out.}
